                        Hello, I'm <strong>João Pedro</strong> Monteiro, originally from Brazil and I have been living in Netherlands for 1 year. I have a background in geology, and I'm currently in the process of a career transition to the field of IT, with a specific focus on becoming a front-end developer.<br><br>

                        My journey from geology to front-end development has been driven by a deep passion for technology and a desire to create engaging and user-friendly web experiences. I'm excited about the ever-evolving world of web development and the creative opportunities it offers.
